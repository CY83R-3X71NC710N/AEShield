# AEShield - README

## Description
AEShield is a python program designed to securely protect IoT devices with AES-128 encryption. It utilizes Python libraries like pyAesCrypt, Crypto, and hashlib. This project takes the user's given password and produces a key in PBKDF2 format. An HMAC signature is also generated to provide an additional layer of security. Comments have been included for each line of code for further explanation. The project is subject to the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>pyAesCrypt</li>
  <li>Crypto</li>
  <li>hashlib</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine 
2. Install the prerequisites
3. Execute the python program included using `python main.py`

## Prototype
As AEShield is a prototype, it should be built upon to become more powerful. The URLs and any keys included may need to be updated for use on your own local machine. The purpose of the prototype is to provide a starting point for integration into an individual's or corporation's network security system. 

## Goals
The goal of this project is to provide an extra layer of defense to networks that are targeted by malicious actors. This project provides a robust solution for protecting IoT devices, as well as across an entire network. Additionally, AES encryption is one of the most secure methods for ensuring that any communication sent or received across a network is properly secured.

## Roadmap
<ul>
  <li>Implement further security measures</li>
  <li>Improve the user interface</li>
  <li>Increase compatibility across devices and platforms</li>
  <li>Fully implement HMAC signature</li>
  <li>Introduce more encryption methods </li>
  <li>Extend compatibility to all Python programming languages </li>
  <li>Create an open-source alternative to any closed-source APIs used</li>
</ul>
